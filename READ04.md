|vertically scalable           |databases are horizontally 
|uses SQL for defining and manipulating the data| queries are focused on collection of documents
|good fit for the complex query|not good fit for complex queries
|not best fit for hierarchical data storage|fits better for the hierarchical data storage 
|vertically scalable            |horizontally scalable
|emphasizes on ACID properties  |Brewers CAP theorem
