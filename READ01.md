# An Introduction to Node.js
## What is  Node.js?

 is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript

## Benefits of Node:
- Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems
- Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing both client-side and server-side code.
- JavaScript is a relatively new programming language and benefits from improvements in language design when compared to other traditional web-server languages (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.)
- The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages
- Node.js is portable and well-supported by many web hosting providers.
- It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing to help.

 # Introducing Express
 Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.

 ## Commands of Express :
 - POST
 - DELETE
 - PUT 
 - GET

 # NPM 
 ### npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

 ## Npm distinct components:
 - the website
 - the Command Line Interface (CLI)
 - the registry

 ## Used to:
 - Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
 - Download standalone tools you can use right away.
 - Run packages without downloading using npx.
 - Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
 - Restrict code to specific developers.
 - Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
 - Form virtual teams by using organizations.
 - Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
 - Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
 - Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
 - Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.
 # TDD
 ## "Test-driven development" refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven:
 - Coding
 - Testing
 - Design
 ## It can be succinctly described by the following set of rules:
 -  Write a “single” unit test describing an aspect of the program.
 - Run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature.
 - Write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass.
 - “Refactor” the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria.
 - Repeat, “accumulating” unit tests over time.

 # CI/CD
 ### CI "Continuous Integration": is a workflow strategythat helps ensure everyone's changes will integrate with the current version of the project. This lets you catch bugs, reduce merge conflicts, and have confidence your software is working. CD "Continuous Delivery": is the practice of developing software in such a way that you could release it at any time. When coupled with CI, continuous delivery lets you develop features with modular code in more manageable increments.
