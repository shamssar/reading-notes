# Access Control (ACL)
* What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization.
and we care about it Case in point: the 2017 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report found that 81 percent of hacking-related breaches involved compromised credentials.
The number of possible permutations of access settings in such a small environment is huge.

## Benefits of RBAC?
* he assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.
* easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.
## alternatives for/variations of RBAC
- Access control lists (ACL) 
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

## RBAC implementation :
1. Inventory your systems
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
3. Assign people to roles
4. Never make one-off changes
5. Audit

## Relation to other models
RBAC is a flexible access control technology whose flexibility allows it to implement DAC[7] or MAC.[8] DAC with groups (e.g., as implemented in POSIX file systems) can emulate RBAC.[9] MAC can simulate RBAC if the role graph is restricted to a tree rather than a partially ordered set.

## Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:
- Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
- Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. 
- Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. 

## The NIST/ANSI/INCITS RBAC standard (2004) recognizes three levels of RBAC:
- core RBAC
- hierarchical RBAC, which adds support for inheritance between roles
- constrained RBAC, which adds separation of duties
