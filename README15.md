# AWS: S3 and Lambda

Describe “The Cloud”

* "The Cloud" is a bunch of very powerful servers that spin up virtual machines that can act as a server and host content as needed. This moves the capital expense assoicated with a server to the cloud provider in exchange for a fee based on usage.
What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

* Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object. Containers share an operating system installed on the server and run as resource-isolated processes, ensuring quick, reliable, and consistent deployments, regardless of environment. source
What is auto-scaling?

* Auto-scaling is when resources automatically increase or decrease to meet the demand of the clients accessing the hosted platform.
What is bandwidth?

*Bandwidth is a measurement indicating the maximum capacity of a wired or wireless communications link to transmit data over a network connection in a given amount of time. source
How do cloud providers compute service costs?

* AWS Lambda computes service costs based on Request number, memory and run time, and outbound network traffic.

### Server Instances

* Server Instances are virtual machines spun up in the cloud to act as a server for a given applications client requests.
### Containers

* Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object. Containers share an operating system installed on the server and run as resource-isolated processes, ensuring quick, reliable, and consistent deployments, regardless of environment. source
### Cloud Services

* Services that are provided to clients that are hosted in the cloud.
### Cloud Architecture

* Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network. The components of a cloud architecture include:
- A front-end platform (the client or device used to access the cloud)
- A back-end platform (servers and storage)
- A cloud-based delivery model
- A network

### AWS

* Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform operated by Amazon.
### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

* heroku is a wrapper around AWS EC2/Beanstalk that handles the AWS deployment configurations
* EC2/Beanstalk does pretty much the same thing, just directly deployed to the service
