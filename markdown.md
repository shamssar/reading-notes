# Markdown
### Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

# Examples: 
 - you can edit text by make it bold using ** ** symbol and italic using * * symbol.
- you can make lists by starting the line with - or *
- you can add link by putting the word you want to link between brackets [] and then putting the link between two arches ()
