# Redux Toolkit
The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

"Configuring a Redux store is too complicated" "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful" "Redux requires too much boilerplate code" We can't solve every use case, but in the spirit of create-react-app, we can try to provide some tools that abstract over the setup process and handle the most common use cases, as well as include some useful utilities that will let the user simplify their application code.

Redux Toolkit also includes a powerful data fetching and caching capability that we've dubbed "RTK Query". It's included in the package as a separate set of entry points. It's optional, but can eliminate the need to hand-write data fetching logic yourself.

These tools should be beneficial to all Redux users. Whether you're a brand new Redux user setting up your first project, or an experienced user who wants to simplify an existing application, Redux Toolkit can help you make your Redux code better.

Installation​Using Create React

What's Included​Redux Toolkit includes these APIs:

configureStore(): wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes redux-thunk by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension. createReducer(): that lets you supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, rather than writing switch statements. In addition, it automatically uses the immer library to let you write simpler immutable updates with normal mutative code, like state.todos[3].completed = true. createAction(): generates an action creator function for the given action type string. The function itself has toString() defined, so that it can be used in place of the type constant. createSlice(): accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types. createAsyncThunk: accepts an action type string and a function that returns a promise, and generates a thunk that dispatches pending/fulfilled/rejected action types based on that promise createEntityAdapter: generates a set of reusable reducers and selectors to manage normalized data in the store The createSelector utility from the Reselect library, re-exported for ease of use. RTK Query​RTK Query is provided as an optional addon within the @reduxjs/toolkit package. It is purpose-built to solve the use case of data fetching and caching, supplying a compact, but powerful toolset to define an API interface layer for your app. It is intended to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.

RTK Query is built on top of the Redux Toolkit core for its implementation, using Redux internally for its architecture. Although knowledge of Redux and RTK are not required to use RTK Query, you should explore all of the additional global store management capabilities they provide, as well as installing the Redux DevTools browser extension, which works flawlessly with RTK Query to traverse and replay a timeline of your request & cache behavior.

The core idea State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications than by producing an inconsistent state or state that is out-of-sync with local variables that linger around. Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalized, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like classes in case you fancy those.

MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. The strategy to achieve that is simple: Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically.

Making React reactive Ok, so far we made a silly report reactive. Time to build a reactive user interface around this very same store. React components are (despite their name) not reactive out of the box. The observer HoC wrapper from the mobx-react-lite package fixes that by basically wrapping the React component in autorun. This keeps the component in sync with the state. This is conceptually not different from what we did with the report before.

The next listing defines a few React components. The only MobX specific code in there is the observer wrapping. That is enough to make sure that each component individually re-renders when relevant data changes. We don't have to call state useState setters anymore, nor do we have to figure out how to subscribe to the proper parts of the application state using selectors or higher order components that need configuration. Basically, all components have become smart. Yet they are defined in a dumb, declarative manner.

Conclusion That's all! No boilerplate. Just some simple, declarative components that form our complete UI. And which are derived completely, reactively from our state. You are now ready to start using the mobx and mobx-react-lite packages in your own applications. A short summary of the things you learned so far:

Use the observable decorator or observable(object or array) functions to make objects trackable for MobX. The computed decorator can be used to create functions that can automatically derive value from the state and cache them. Use autorun to automatically run functions that depend on some observable state. This is useful for logging, making network requests, etc. Use the observer wrapper from the mobx-react-lite package to make your React components truly reactive. They will update automatically and efficiently. Even when used in large complex applications with large amounts of data. Feel free to play around a bit longer with the editable code blocks above to get a basic feeling how MobX reacts to all your changes. You could for example add a log statement to the report function to see when it is called. Or don't show the report at all and see how that influences the rendering of the TodoList. Or show it only under specific circumstances...

MobX doesn't dictate architecture Please note that the above examples are contrived and it is recommended to use proper engineering practices like encapsulating logic in methods, organize them in stores or controllers, view-models etc. Many different architectural patterns can be applied, and some are further discussed inside the official docs. The above examples, and the examples in the official documentation show how MobX could be used, not how it must be used. Or, as somebody on HackerNews put it:

“MobX, it's been mentioned elsewhere but I can't help but sing its praises. Writing in MobX means that using controllers/ dispatchers/ actions/ supervisors or another form of managing dataflow returns to being an architectural concern you can pattern to your application's needs, rather than being something that's required by default for anything more than a Todo app.”
